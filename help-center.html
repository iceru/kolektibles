                        2. Avoid using easily guessable information, such as your name or birthdate.
                        3. Use at least 12 characters for the password.
                        4. Avoid using common words or phrases.
                        5. Change your password regularly.

                        Remembering these steps will help you create a strong and secure password that will protect your

                        The market value of a collectible item generated from internal data of Kolektibles platform is
                        determined by analyzing various factors such as demand, rarity, condition, and historical sales
                        data. Collectors may also take into account the popularity of the toy or collectible, as well as
                        any notable features or characteristics that make it unique. The platform uses this information
                        to provide an estimated value for the item, which can be used as a guide for buyers and sellers.
                        This value can change over time as market conditions and demand for the item fluctuates. It is
                        important to note that the market value generated from internal data is not a guarantee of the
                        item's actual value and should be used as a reference only. Ultimately, the final sale price of
                        a collectible item is determined by the buyer and seller's negotiation.
                        <br />
                        The market value of a toy collection or collectible item can also change over time. For example,
                        a toy that was once considered common and inexpensive may become rare and highly sought after,
                        driving up its value. Conversely, a toy that was once considered valuable may lose its appeal
                        and decrease in value.
                        <br />
                        Collectors and buyers can determine the market value of a toy collection or collectible item by
                        researching similar items on e-commerce sites or by consulting with experts in the field. They
                        can also attend toy and collectible shows, where they can see and purchase items from a variety
                        of sellers. It's important to note that the market value of a toy collection or collectible item
                        is not always the same as its sentimental value. A collector may be willing to pay a high price
                        for an item that holds personal significance, even if it is not considered valuable in the
                        market.
                        <br />
                        Overall, the market value of a toy collection or collectible item is determined by a variety of
                        factors and can fluctuate over time. It is important for collectors and buyers to conduct
                        research and consult experts in order to determine the current market value of an item.

                        B2B cooperation between toys brands and Kolektibles platform can be beneficial for both parties.
